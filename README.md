## System requirements

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- Qdrant Vector Database. Refer to the Qdrant documentation for instructions: https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/
- Qdrant client library (install with `pip install qdrant-client`)
- ArangoDB for graph database
- Redis or Apache Kafka for data processing on queue
- Large language models (LLMs) likes Google Gemini or OpenAI   

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trieu/resynap
```

2. Create env
```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the Qdrant server:
```bash
   ./start_qdrant.sh
```

5. Next, create a .env file by coping the file sample.env or create your own file with content:
```
    QDRANT_HOST=localhost
    QDRANT_PORT=6333

    QDRANT_CLOUD_HOST=
    QDRANT_CLOUD_API_KEY=

    API_HOST=0.0.0.0
    API_PORT=8000

    REDIS_HOST=
    REDIS_PORT=0
    DEFAULT_AUTHORIZATION_KEY=personalization_test
```

## Running the API

```bash
uvicorn main:api_personalization --reload 
```
This will start the API server. You can access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## API Endpoints

    All API Endpoints must be called with the header: Authorization = [your_api_key]
    The [your_api_key] must be in Redis. E.g: 127.0.0.1:6480> set personalization_test true
